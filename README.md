# Applied-Numerical-Methods
Source codes for popular methods used in *numerical analysis*.

A numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems, including root finding, interpolation, solving initial value problems for first and higher order differential equations, and so on.

These code snippets provide generalizable functions in numerical analysis, and can be easily adopted by calling them directly, just like what is written in the main function.
